# 🚀 Sam AI Project Handover Summary

## Project Overview
**Sam AI** is a multi-tenant SaaS sales automation platform that combines traditional campaign management (Expandi-style) with AI-powered chat interface (Devon-style). The platform features dual modes: Chat Mode (AI agents handle tasks) and Work Mode (manual campaign management).

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed:
- **Multi-tenant database schema design** (Supabase foundation)
- **Frontend UI/UX completed in Lovable** (production-ready design)
- **Component architecture analysis** and technical specifications
- **Backend integration requirements** defined
- **GitHub repository setup** with staging/production workflow
- **Netlify deployment** configured and ready
- **Complete React application** built and deployed to staging

### 🔄 Next Phase: Backend Implementation & AI Agent System Development

## Frontend Design Management Process

### Design Authority: Lovable
- **All UI/UX** is implemented and managed in Lovable
- **Existing design** is the source of truth
- **No direct frontend code changes** outside of Lovable

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Early Design Change Briefing
Design changes must be briefed as early as possible to ensure:
- Database schema includes all necessary fields
- API endpoints are designed with correct data structures
- Real-time subscriptions capture required events
- Data migrations are planned before deployment

## Repository Structure

### Current Setup:
```

└── docs/                      # Technical documentation
```

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (Deployed):
- **React 18** + **TypeScript** + **Vite**
- **shadcn/ui** + **Radix UI** components
- **Tailwind CSS** styling
- **Zustand** + **TanStack Query** state management
- **React Router DOM** routing
- **ElevenLabs** voice integration

### Backend (To Implement):
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth)
- **Edge Functions** for AI processing
- **Row Level Security** (RLS) for multi-tenancy
- **OpenRouter** for AI model integration

## Deployment Architecture

### Staging Environment:
- **Branch**: `staging`
- **URL**: Auto-generated by Netlify
- **Updates**: Direct commits to staging branch
- **Purpose**: Development and testing

### Production Environment:
- **Branch**: `main`
- **URL**: Production domain
- **Updates**: PR from staging to main (protected)
- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing application

## Critical Success Factors

### Process:
- ✅ **Early briefing** prevents backend rework
- ⚠️ **Schema planning** before any code changes
- 📋 **Field mappings** maintained continuously
- 🔌 **API contracts** defined upfront

### Technical:
- 🗃️ **Database schema** supports all UI requirements
- 🔍 **No missing fields** during frontend implementation
- ⚡ **Real-time events** properly designed
- 🔄 **Migration paths** planned for all changes

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Backend Development Priority:
- [ ] Set up Supabase project and database
- [ ] Implement multi-tenant schema
- [ ] Create API endpoints for existing UI
- [ ] Set up authentication and RLS policies

### 2. AI Agent Integration:
- [ ] Design AI agent architecture
- [ ] Implement chat interface backend
- [ ] Connect to OpenRouter/LLM services
- [ ] Set up voice processing pipeline

### 3. Campaign Management:
- [ ] Build campaign CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement automation workflows
- [ ] Create prospect management system
- [ ] Set up analytics and reporting

## Design Change Process Template

When any design modification is identified:

### Phase 1: Early Briefing (ASAP)
```markdown
# Design Change Brief - [Date] - [Component/Feature]

## Change Overview
Brief description of the proposed UI/UX change

## Data Requirements (CRITICAL)
### New Fields Needed:
- field_name: data_type // Description and usage

### Modified Fields:
- existing_field: new_requirements // What changes

## Database Schema Impact
### New Tables Required:
- table_name: purpose and relationships

## API Contract Changes
### New Endpoints:
- POST /api/new-endpoint - purpose and payload
```

## Current Deployment Status

### ✅ Ready for Production:
- **Frontend Application**: Complete and deployed
- **GitHub Integration**: Active with staging/production workflow  
- **Build System**: Optimized Vite build (1.24MB bundle, 339KB gzipped)
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Netlify auto-deploy from GitHub

### 🔧 Pending Backend:
- Database setup and schema implementation
- API endpoint development
- Authentication system
- AI agent integration
- Real-time features

---

**🎯 SUCCESS DEPENDS ON EARLY DESIGN BRIEFING**: All UI/UX changes must be documented with data requirements BEFORE any development begins. This ensures the backend has all necessary fields and APIs ready when the frontend team needs them.
