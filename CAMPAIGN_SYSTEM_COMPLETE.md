## How Sam Creates "On Point" Messages

1. **Trigger Recognition**: Identifies buying signals (funding, hiring, new leadership)
2. **Pain Point Mapping**: Matches prospect situation to known pain points
3. **Social Proof Selection**: Chooses case studies from similar companies
4. **Value Prop Alignment**: Highlights differentiators that address specific needs
5. **Timing Optimization**: Spaces messages based on sales cycle length

## Example Generated Message
```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} is hiring data engineers - congrats! 
This usually means data silos become even more critical.

We just helped TechCorp achieve 25% faster deal closure by 
addressing exactly this challenge.

Worth connecting to share how we did it?
```

**Sam's Reasoning**: "Using trigger event (hiring) and relevant case study (TechCorp). 
Technical tone for engineering leader. Leveraging social proof from similar SaaS company."
